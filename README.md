Vehicle Safety and Operational Assistance Systems
========

The purpose of this report was to document the development of a real-time embedded system.
The report demonstrates how the vehicle safety and operational assistance systems ABS, TCS, EDC, AEB, EAEB, LDES, and ACC can be implemented on a LEGO Mindstorms robot. The report also contains an analysis of the hardware of the LEGO Mindstorms platform, the system architecture of the real-time operating system used, and the analysis, and implementation of each of the safety systems. Additionally the report contains documentation on how a real-time analysis was performed for the embedded system. The completed system was scheduable, despite minor issues with some features. All features performed acceptably.

There is no history in this repositiory since the project has been developed on a SVN repo hosted at Aalborg Univisity.
